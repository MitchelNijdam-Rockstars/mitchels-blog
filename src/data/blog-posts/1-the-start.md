Every end must have a beginning, so if you are reading this, welcome to my blog journey.

The world is currently in a state of flux. AI is making headlines every day, changes in geopolitics 
are having real impact on our lives and the climate crisis is becoming more and more apparent.

Luckily for me, I am an optimist and with changes come opportunities. I will be writing these blogs mostly
for myself, as a creative outlet, but I hope you will find some value in them as well.
