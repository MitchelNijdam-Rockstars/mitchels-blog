    <p>Hey, welcome to my personal blog! My name is Mitchel Nijdam, and this is the space where I share my
      thoughts, knowledge, experiences and opinions. Every opinion you'll read here is my own, and I am not speaking on
      behalf of any company or brand, although I am currently employed at
      <a href="https://www.teamrockstars.nl/" target="_blank">Team Rockstars IT.</a></p>

    <p>For over 7 years now I am practicing the art of coding. I've always been keen on sharing knowledge with other
      people, and have even been opinionated at times. Topics such as Apache Kafka, Kotlin, Spring Boot,
      Kubernetes and AI are what I love to talk about. I have been a speaker at several meetups and conferences,
      where the stress beforehand is always worth the dopamine boost after.</p>

    <p>In the age of AI that we find ourselves in, I feel that it is my duty to influence the direction of this
      powerful technology. It should benefit all of humanity, and not just the already powerful.
      I will write blogs about both the optimistic side (what is technically possible) and the pessimistic side
      (what impact will it have).</p>

    <p>Do you enjoy my blog? Please let me know on
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchel-nijdam/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
