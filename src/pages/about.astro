    <p>On the right you find my family crest - or at least, an AI interpretation of it.
      <a href="https://www.nijdamstra.nl/Familiewapen/Nijdam-Familiewapen/" target="_blank">The original</a> is much
      cooler but doesn't fit my blog's modern style. Why is this relevant you might wonder? Well, the Nijdams have been
      a family of craftspeople. From butcher shops to woodworking, I've grown up loving working with my hands.</p>

    <p>Coding and software development is also a craft, in my opinion. I've been practicing this art for over seven
      years now, and I've always been keen on sharing knowledge with others - hence this blog. Topics such as
      Apache Kafka, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Kubernetes and AI are things I love to talk about. I have been a speaker at
      several meetups and conferences; the stress beforehand is always worth the dopamine boost I get afterward, seeing
      that people genuinely enjoyed it.</p>

    <p>In the age of AI that we now find ourselves in, I feel a personal responsibility to help steer this powerful
      technology in the right direction. It should benefit all of us - not just the already powerful and wealthy.
      I'll write blogs about both the optimistic side (what's technically possible) and the pessimistic side
      (what the impact might be).</p>

    <p>Anyway, welcome to my personal blog! My name is Mitchel Nijdam, and this is the space where I share my
      thoughts, knowledge, experiences and opinions. Every opinion you read here is my own; I don't speak on
      behalf of any company or brand, although I am currently employed at
      <a href="https://www.teamrockstars.nl/" target="_blank">Team Rockstars IT.</a></p>
